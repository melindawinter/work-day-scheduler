# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I have created a work day planner that is updated using momentjs. The planner saves events in local storage so that they can be accessed even after closing the browser tab. The user will enter an event for a specific time slot and click the Save button. Events can be overwritten as needed. During the work day, the time slots will be color coded to show whether events are past, future, or currently taking place at a glance. The day and date will be automatically updated.
